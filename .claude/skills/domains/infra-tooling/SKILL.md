## Start Here

1. `.context/BRIEF.md` — project overview, read FIRST for any task
2. `nx.json` — Nx monorepo configuration
3. `CLAUDE.md` — agent entry point, design system rules, token conventions

## Public API

(none — meta domain, no code exports)

## Invariants

- **Layout Maker yaml supports `nested-slots: string[]` per slot.** Validator enforces: (1) all referenced children must be declared in `slots`, (2) no slot nested under >1 parent, (3) no cycles (reports full path: `a -> b -> c -> a`). (WP-020)
- **html-generator emits nested `<div data-slot="child"></div>` inside the parent tag**, zero whitespace between tags (required for `resolveSlots` regex compatibility in portal). (WP-020)
- **css-generator skips `.slot-inner` rules for container slots** (they have no `.slot-inner` — they contain other `data-slot` elements). Container outer rules (min-height, flex, background) are preserved. (WP-020)
- **css-generator emits `container-type: inline-size; container-name: slot` on the generic `[data-slot] > .slot-inner` rule.** Exposes each leaf slot's inline width to block CSS `@container slot (max-width: …)` queries. Container slots correctly skip — they hold nested `<div data-slot="child">`, not `.slot-inner`, so the selector never matches them. Contract test in `css-generator.test.ts` asserts both the emission and the container-slot exclusion. (WP-024 / ADR-025)

## Traps & Gotchas

- **`.context/` is the agent entry point.** Reading order: BRIEF.md -> current layer spec -> CONVENTIONS.md.
- **workplan/*.md files are volatile** — new files added frequently, not tracked individually in manifest.
- **tools/studio-mockups/** serves block preview HTML on :7777 during /block-craft skill.
- **tools/sync-tokens/** has Figma config for token pipeline.
- **yaml `scope` must match DB `scope`.** The drift between `scope: theme-page-layout` (yaml) and `scope: "theme"` (DB) was caught and fixed in WP-020. Always verify scope alignment before a DB push. (WP-020)
- **DB may carry visual params not in yaml** — drifted via Studio edits or older generator runs. Before regenerating from yaml, diff against DB state to catch silent regressions. (WP-020)
