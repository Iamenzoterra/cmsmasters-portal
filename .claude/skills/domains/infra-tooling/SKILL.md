## Start Here

1. `.context/BRIEF.md` — project overview, read FIRST for any task
2. `nx.json` — Nx monorepo configuration
3. `CLAUDE.md` — agent entry point, design system rules, token conventions

## Public API

(none — meta domain, no code exports)

## Traps & Gotchas

- **`.context/` is the agent entry point.** Reading order: BRIEF.md -> current layer spec -> CONVENTIONS.md.
- **workplan/*.md files are volatile** — new files added frequently, not tracked individually in manifest.
- **tools/studio-mockups/** serves block preview HTML on :7777 during /block-craft skill.
- **tools/sync-tokens/** has Figma config for token pipeline.
